## [0.5.0] — 2026-05-12

### Added
- Stripe billing — full hexagonal BillingModule: checkout session, customer portal, webhook handler at `/api/v1/stripe/webhook`
- Auto-import all repos after Stripe upgrade to PRO
- Upgrade modal — Radix Dialog with Monthly/Annual toggle (20% off yearly), 3 plans, MOST POPULAR badge; mounted globally via Zustand
- Settings → Billing tab — current plan, next billing date, Stripe portal for paid users
- Per-user auto-sync prefs — `autoSyncEnabled` + `autoSyncIntervalHours` (1h/6h/24h); cron respects each user's interval
- Team plan waitlist — `WaitlistEntry` DB table, `joinWaitlist` mutation, waitlist form UI on `/team`
- Year in Code — `/year/[year]` Wrapped-style page with 6 stat cards, streak callout, month breakdown, year nav; sidebar linked (PRO gate)
- Reviews KPI card on dashboard with sparkline and trend
- Personal records toast — trophy notification after sync when today's commits/additions/netLines beat all-time daily best
- Streak freeze — `useStreakFreeze` mutation; FREE gets 1 lifetime freeze, PRO unlimited; button on `/streaks`
- Public profile secondary stats — lines written, PRs opened, avg commits/active day on `/u/[username]`
- Public profile rank pills — Top X% by lines/PRs/commit intensity/active days; gated on `userCount ≥ 10`
- `githubUsername` column on User — persisted on every OAuth; auto-populates `username` on first login
- Delete account — `deleteAccount` mutation + two-step confirm in Settings → Danger zone
- Public profile visibility toggles — `publicShowStreak` / `publicShowRepos` in Settings
- Evolution tab on `/repos` — LanguageStream streamgraph (year-over-year language adoption)
- Global search — command-palette style, DevPulse profile + GitHub API fallback
- Public repo analysis — `/r/[owner]/[repo]` SSR page; reachable from landing page search bar
- Landing page repo search bar routing to `/r/[owner]/[repo]`
- Onboarding prompt — "Track your first repo" CTA when no repos tracked
- Streak milestone card — Spotify Wrapped-style, 6 milestones (7/30/60/100/200/365), localStorage-persisted dismissal
- Streak at-risk banner — amber banner after 20:00 UTC with countdown
- Notifications bell — in-session sync-complete and sync-error events
- og:image — edge runtime `opengraph-image.tsx`, 1200×627 with real stats
- Share + embed buttons on public profiles
- SEO — robots.ts, sitemap.ts, rich metadata

### Changed
- Plan limits restructured: FREE = 10 repos + 90-day history; PRO = unlimited repos + all-time history + Year in Code + rank pills; TEAM = same as PRO (waitlist)
- Sync cron changed from fixed 6-hour global to per-user interval (1h/6h/24h) with enabled toggle
- Public profile opt-in now correctly enforced in `PublicProfileService` (was always-public bug)
- `isPrivate` on repo detail now reads from DB field, not star/fork heuristic
- `importFromGitHub` returns `{ imported, tracked }` object (was returning `boolean`)
- Streak milestone comparison uses `≤` (was exact `===`, missing users between milestones)
- Settings name state initialization moved to `useEffect` (was mutating state in render body)

### Fixed
- ESLint errors blocking production build
- Stripe SDK v22 `currentPeriodEnd` read from subscription item (not subscription root)
- Streak row ensured to exist before recalculate on first sync
- `upsertRepository` now updates `isTracked` on re-import
- Non-null assertion for `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` in `importFromGitHub`
